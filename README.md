I’m an early-career cognitive neuroscience researcher interested in how the brain learns and adapts through experience. My work focuses on “sensitive periods” in early development, which are times when the brain is especially likely to change in response to the environment. So far, I’ve studied neuroplasticity in the human visual cortex using EEG, MRI, and behavioral experiments with blind participants and with people who regained vision after being born with dense congenital cataracts.

I completed my PhD in 2024 with Prof. Brigitte Röder at the University of Hamburg, supported by the Hector Fellow Academy, and in collaboration with the LV Prasad Eye Institute. Before that, I completed my Master's degree at Johns Hopkins University with Prof. Brenda Rapp, and worked as a lab manager in Prof. Marina Bedny's laboratory. Right now, I am working on computer vision AI for cancer diagnostics/histopathology at Mindpeak GmbH.
