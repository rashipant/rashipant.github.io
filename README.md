I am an early-career researcher in cognitive neuroscience, and I am interested in how the brain learns and changes with experience, particularly during early development. My work so far has been in neuroplasticity in the human visual cortex, studying phases of heightened plasticity called sensitive periods. We do this by conducting EEG, MRI and behavioral studies with blind individuals and people who recover vision after being born with dense congenital cataracts. 

I completed my PhD in July 2024 with Prof. Brigitte Röder at the University of Hamburg, supported by the Hector Fellow Academy, and in collaboration with the LV Prasad Eye Institute. Before that, I completed my Master's degree at Johns Hopkins University with Prof. Brenda Rapp, and worked as a lab manager in Prof. Marina Bedny's laboratory.
