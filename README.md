I am an early-career researcher in cognitive neuroscience. I completed my PhD in July 2024 with Prof. Brigitte Röder, at the University of Hamburg. Before that, I completed my Master's degree at Johns Hopkins University with Prof. Brenda Rapp, and worked as a lab manager  in Prof. Marina Bedny's laboratory.
